    "description": "Citroen refreshed the DS3 model in 2016, and, along with the facelift, it introduced its premium brand named DS Automobiles.When Citroen introduced the DS model in the '50s, it was the most successful car in history, with orders piling up at a considerable rate. Only the Tesla Model 3 exceeded the same number in the first 24 hours since its launch. Just remember that there was no Internet nor live streaming in the '50s. Fast forward six decades, and the French carmaker considered that it was time to establish the DS Automobile as a distinct brand, and it started with this: the DS3.\n\nThe refreshed Citroen DS3 lost its Citroen badge but gained a new one. There were no \"double-chevron\" logos on the car\u2014only the DS one, which took center stage on the front grille and the tailgate. To make the small-segment vehicle looks premium, it added a chromed trim around the grille. Its innovative LED-Xenon headlights were unique on the market when the car was introduced, and not only on the small segment. The car's profile remained the same, with a raked-forward B-pillar and a darkened C-pillar that created the illusion of a wrapped-around rear glass area.\n\nInside, DS Automobiles featured higher quality materials than in any regular Citroen. The DS3 sported a carbon-fiber look for the dashboard, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and handbrake. Its bucket seats were made more for comfort but with high bolstering areas. In the back, there was hardly room for three people, and even two were cramped. The rear seatback didn't fold flat, but it added some volume to the trunk.\n\nUnder the hood, the DS3 offered a choice of gasoline, and turbo-diesel engines ranged between 82 hp and 160 hp.",

The new generation started with the use of an existing platform, but with different bodyworks. Citroen DS3 was the first to break the ice and it became the best selling supermini premium car in Europe when it was introduced in 2010. In 2014 the DS3 was facelifted.\n\nOn the outside, the DS3 featured a combination of Xenon and LED headlights with sequential turn signals. For the night driving, both LED and Xenon was lit to create a wider, uniform, area. At the front, in the air-intakes, new signature LEDs for daytime running lights were installed. The taillights were LEDs as well and, when they were lit, the 3D light featured a chrome-finish DS logo in a black embossed DS setting.\n\nInside, the DS3 featured a five-seat configuration but due to the short wheelbase, the legroom was limited. The infotainment system was mounted on top of the center stack and contained the navigation and the stereo. The available reversing camera sent the image on the same screen.\n\nThe DS3 was considered a sporty hatchback and it was fitted with engines that could deliver some performance. It was the base car for the DS3 WRC, which competed in the World Rally Championship. Under the hood, the street version was fitted with a choice of diesel and gasoline units ranged between 100 hp and 207 hp. Depending on the engine, it was available with a 5- or 6-speed manual, a 4- or a 6-speed automatic.",

The DS7 had a special design, with a big 3D hexagonal grille. The angry headlights had LED fitted as standard and its three crystal-look LED lights had an angry look, like a pissed-off musketeer. From the side, it looked more like an SUV instead of a lifted station wagon, with a nice roof spoiler above the tailgate. \n\nThe interior design looked very different than most of the premium SUV vehicles on the market. The dashboard was covered in Alcantara, seats were bolstered and there were no dials inside the cabin. In front of the driver, there was a customizable TFT display and on top of the center console, it was the infotainment touch-screen display. It had some buttons for shortcuts to the HVAC, navigation, and sound system. In the back, there was seating for three adults and a nearly flat floor, that made it possible for the middle passenger to actually fit into place. \n\nThe technical platform was the same as for the Peugeot 3008 and Citroen C5 Aircross and featured the same engine and transmissions. The DS7 featured only front-wheel-drive versions and the only gearbox available was an 8-speed automatic.",

In the DS lineup, the car will replace the DS 3.\n\nJust a little over four meters long, the first subcompact crossover from DS has a rather large engine lineup for a French premium car, especially since from mid 2019 it will also have a full-electric version. On the gasoline front there are three choices - with 100, 130 and 155 horsepower - while a diesel with 100 horsepower completes the internal combustion engine lineup. Called the DS 3 Crossback E-Tense, the electric version set to arrive later in the lineup is powered by a single electric motor with 136 horsepower and 260 Nm (191.8 lb-ft) of torque. Thanks to a 50 kWh lithium-ion battery situated under the floor, the car has a range of over 300 km (186 miles) with the WLTP cycle and about 450 km (280 miles) in the NEDC testing cycle.",

It might be considered as a facelift with a new badge on the car since there were absolutely no Citroen badges on the vehicle. But that didn't say that the car was not built by Citroen. The DS5 was the flagship of the French car-maker and it tried to build it as good as it could, but with a price-tag limit on its mind.\n\nThe egg-shape of the vehicle was a hatchback but styled to not look just like a regular compact MPV. It featured a floating roof design, thanks to the enlarged and Z-shaped rear quarter panels. The headlights were long and integrated nicely into a front fascia that tried to become specific for the DS brand.\n\nInside, the cabin was arranged as a cockpit. There were buttons on the center console, on the right side of the steering wheel, on the dashboard, and even on the car's ceiling. It was imagined as an airplane cockpit. Just like the Citroen DS, a car design by aircraft engineers. Unlike most of the Citroen products, the DS5 was carefully crafted with big attention to details.\n\nThe drivetrain featured platforms taken from other cars from the PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) group. It was offered with a choice of turbocharged gasoline and diesel units. A special hybrid diesel-electric was available, with an all-wheel-drive system. A 6-speed transmission was fitted as standard.",

Over time, Citroen's aura started to fade, and it became just a shadow of the glorious brand it used to be. But that was changed in 2015 when the company's management decided to restore its golden age and introduced the DS Automobile as a premium brand for Citroen. The new brand evolved from Citroen as a premium carmaker in the same way that Infiniti grew from Nissan, Lexus from Toyota, or Acura from Honda.\n\nThe DS4 was a creative mix between a compact and a crossover vehicle. By 2021, its three LED headlamps were already a lighting signature for the French carmaker. Its broad grille extended from the hood to the bottom of the apron, filling the space between the headlights, was a bold statement for the French carmaker. The sloped C-pillars enhanced the car's sporty look in a way that only the glorious Citroen SM dared to be.\n\nInside, the French designers imagined a cabin with an exclusive look and high-quality materials. They mixed the refinement and the technology in a way that few carmakers could ever do. The leather-wrapped dashboard featured a center-mounted infotainment touch-screen and another TFT display in the instrument cluster.\n\nBased on the EMP2 platform, the DS4 shared its underpinning with other Citroen and Peugeot products. It featured a wide range of diesel, gasoline, and plug-in hybrid powertrains.",
